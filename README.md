# Tiny Interepter and Compiler

A tiny interpreter and compiler which shows the basics of compiler development.

For more details see [the source](./tiny.js) or my blog post "[Implementing a Simple Compiler on 25 Lines of JavaScript](http://blog.mgechev.com/2017/09/16/developing-simple-interpreter-transpiler-compiler-tutorial/)"

Along the implementation you can find sample (and simple) implementations of:

- Lexer which produces a list of tokens (module for lexical analysis).
- Parser which produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) (module for syntax analysis).
- Interpreter which traverses and evaluates the AST.
- EBNF grammar.
- Recursive Descent Parsing.
